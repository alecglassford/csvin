## 1.0.1 (2018-03-05)

Fixed a typo: Node's Buffer seems to be lenient about using 'utf-8' instead of 'utf8' as an encoding, but its' the right one now. Updated dependencies, and replaced the rollup plugin that bundles dependency licenses: I'd received a security vulnerability notification about the version of Moment used in the old one, and it wouldn't have had any security effect here, but I figured I'd switch anyway because the new one is simpler and I like the output format better. This is all really an exercise in how much silly work a person can put into a "project" that is almost entirely without substance. ðŸ˜• It's â€¦ interesting.

## 1.0.0 (2017-12-01)

Initial release!
